# Vision

## The Problem: Invisible Money

The global derivatives market is valued at over **$600 trillion**. Global GDP is roughly **$100 trillion**. This means the overwhelming majority of financial "activity" exists as abstract transactions with no direct connection to real economic production.

Cash is disappearing — not because money is going away, but because it's becoming **invisible**. Digital transactions, algorithmic trading, and complex financial instruments have created a world where trillions move every day with zero human comprehension of what's actually happening.

**This is not a feature. It's a vulnerability.**

## The Vision: Making Trust Visible

SENTINEL exists to build the **trust visualization infrastructure** the world needs:

### 1. Detect Meaningless Transactions
Not all financial activity creates value. High-frequency trading, synthetic derivatives, and wash trading generate volume without meaning. SENTINEL monitors the gap between financial activity and real economic output, flagging when markets diverge from fundamentals.

### 2. The AI Investment Era is Coming
We are approaching an era where **every human on Earth** will have access to AI-powered investment tools. When that happens, the infrastructure layer — the pipelines that collect, analyze, and deliver market intelligence — becomes the most critical piece of the stack.

**Now is the golden time to build that pipeline.**

### 3. Currency Supply Limits and Trust Design
Bitcoin's core insight wasn't blockchain — it was the **hard cap on supply**. In a world of unlimited money printing, trust erodes. SENTINEL incorporates this philosophy:
- Monitor M2 money supply and central bank balance sheets
- Track the real purchasing power of currencies over time
- Integrate on-chain data where supply rules are transparent and immutable

### 4. Platform Numbers Are Lies
Social media platforms self-report their metrics. Follower counts, engagement rates, view numbers — all controlled by the platform with zero independent verification. This is the same problem as trusting a company to audit its own books.

**The solution: Open-source verification + Blockchain + Proof of Personhood.**

### 5. The Convergence: Blockchain + AI Monitoring + Proof of Personhood

Three technologies are converging to make trust infrastructure possible:

| Technology | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Blockchain** | Immutable record-keeping, transparent supply rules |
| **AI Monitoring** | Pattern detection, anomaly identification, prediction |
| **Proof of Personhood** (World ID) | Verifying real humans behind market-moving signals |

SENTINEL + Katala represents this convergence:
- **SENTINEL** = The nervous system of financial markets (prices, macro, on-chain)
- **Katala** = The nervous system of social markets (influence, sentiment, authenticity)
- **World ID** = The bridge that verifies which signals come from real humans

## Design Principles

1. **Open Source First** — Proprietary market intelligence creates information asymmetry. We reject that.
2. **Verify, Don't Trust** — Every data point should be independently verifiable.
3. **Human-Readable** — Complex analysis must be translated into actionable, understandable signals.
4. **Global by Default** — Built for all markets, all languages, all people.
5. **Privacy-Respecting** — We monitor public signals, never private data.

## Long-Term Goal

SENTINEL aims to become **foundational infrastructure** — the open-source standard for market intelligence that anyone in the world can run, verify, and build upon.

Just as Linux became the operating system of the internet, and Bitcoin became the trust layer for digital value, **SENTINEL aspires to become the trust layer for market intelligence.**
